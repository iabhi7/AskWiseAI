# AskWiseAI Documentation

Welcome to the AskWiseAI documentation. This guide will help you understand, set up, and use the AskWiseAI system.

## What is AskWiseAI?

AskWiseAI is an intelligent question-answering system that combines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the real-time accuracy of external API tools. This hybrid approach allows the system to provide both general knowledge answers and up-to-date, domain-specific information.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatically determines whether to use the LLM or an external tool
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with external APIs for real-time data
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions
- **Caching**: Improves performance and reduces API costs
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new tools and capabilities

## Quick Start

See the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide to set up and run AskWiseAI.
