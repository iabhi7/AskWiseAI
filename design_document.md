# LLM-Based Chat Application

A scalable, modular chat application powered by large language models with advanced memory management and context handling capabilities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture designed for flexibility and scalability:

### Core Components

- **API Layer (`router.py`)**: FastAPI-based routing system that handles HTTP requests/responses and input validation
- **LLM Service (`llm_service.py`)**: Manages interactions with language models, including prompt construction and response generation
- **Memory Management (`memory.py`)**: Implements conversation history storage and retrieval with context window optimization
- **Configuration (`config.py`)**: Centralizes application settings and environment variables
- `main.py`: The entry point for both the Flask server and CLI, orchestrating query processing and response generation.
- `tools.py`: Defines external API tools (get_weather and get_stock_price).
- `prompts.py`: Contains prompt templates for guiding the LLM’s behavior.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies (e.g., Flask, OpenAI, Requests).
- `README.md`: Provides setup instructions and usage examples.


### Architecture Diagram

- `Flask Server (main.py)`:
  - Purpose: Serves as the web interface for external clients.
  - Routes:
    - GET / and POST /: Accept user queries via HTTP requests and return JSON responses.
    - Implementation: Uses Flask to handle incoming requests, process queries, and return responses in a standardized format ({"response": "answer"}).
- `CLI Interface (main.py)`:
  - Purpose: Enables local testing and interaction without a web client.
  - Implementation: Parses command-line arguments (e.g., python main.py -q "What’s the weather in New York?") and prints responses to the console.
- `LLM Module (llm.py)`:
  - Purpose: Interfaces with the OpenAI API to generate responses.
  - Key Function: generate_response(prompt) sends a prompt to the OpenAI model (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo) and returns the generated text.
  - Configuration: Uses an API key stored in an environment variable (OPENAI_API_KEY), loaded via Python’s os module.
- `Tools Module (tools.py)`:
  - Purpose: Defines functions for external API calls.
  - Functions:
    - `get_weather(location)`: Queries the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
    - `get_stock_price(ticker)`: Queries the Alpha Vantage API for stock prices.
  - Implementation: Uses the requests library to make HTTP requests, with placeholder API keys (e.g., WEATHER_API_KEY, STOCK_API_KEY) that users must replace.
- `Prompts Module (prompts.py)`:
  - Purpose: Provides templates to guide the LLM’s decision-making and response formatting.
  - Key Prompt: A system prompt instructs the LLM to:
    - Answer directly if the query is general.
    - Suggest a tool (e.g., [WEATHER:location], [STOCK:ticker]) if the query requires real-time data.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| FastAPI | High-performance API framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation |
| Docker | Containerization for consistent deployment across environments |
| Python | Primary programming language with rich ML/AI ecosystem |
| Redis (planned) | In-memory data store for scalable conversation history |

## Design Decisions and Rationale

### LLM Integration Approach

We implemented a service-based approach for LLM integration for:

1. **Flexibility**: Easy switching between different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Offloading compute-intensive operations to specialized services
3. **Versioning**: Simplified management of model versions and updates
4. **Cost Management**: Better control over API usage and associated costs

### Memory Management Strategy

Our memory system is designed with the following considerations:

1. **Context Window Optimization**: Intelligent truncation to manage token limits while preserving conversation quality
2. **Conversation Persistence**: Reliable storage of conversation history for continuity
3. **Retrieval Efficiency**: Optimized access to relevant conversation parts
4. **Hybrid Retention**: Balances full history retention with summarization techniques

## Scaling from Prototype to Enterprise

### Current Prototype Implementation

- Single container deployment
- In-memory/file-based storage
- Basic authentication
- Simple logging
- Limited redundancy

### Enterprise-Ready Enhancements

| Aspect | Enterprise Approach |
|--------|---------------------|
| Deployment | Kubernetes orchestration with auto-scaling |
| Database | Distributed database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) with sharding |
| Caching | Redis cluster with read replicas |
| Authentication | OAuth2/OIDC with role-based access control |
| Monitoring | ELK stack, Prometheus/Grafana dashboards |
| High Availability | Multi-region deployment, load balancing, failover mechanisms |
| CI/CD | Automated testing, deployment pipelines, canary releases |

## Performance Optimization Strategies

For handling high-volume enterprise workloads:

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for handling request spikes
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless components designed for easy replication
3. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Database Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization, and data partitioning
5. **CDN Integration**: For static assets and potentially cached responses
6. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Model Selection

| Aspect | Smaller Models | Larger Models |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Cost | Lower API costs | Higher API costs |
| Quality | Adequate for simple tasks | Better for complex reasoning |
| Latency | Faster responses (50-500ms) | Slower responses (500ms-2s) |
| Context Window | Limited (4K-8K tokens) | More extensive (16K-100K+ tokens) |
| Deployment | Easier to self-host | Requires significant hardware |

### Memory Management

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Full History | Complete context | Token limit issues, higher costs | Short conversations, critical applications |
| Summarization | Efficient token usage | Potential information loss | Long-running assistants, general chat |
| Selective Retention | Balanced approach | Complexity in implementation | Knowledge-intensive applications |

Our implementation uses a hybrid approach that retains important conversation elements while summarizing less critical parts.

### Deployment Options

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Recommended For |
|----------|------|------|-----------------|
| Self-hosted LLMs | Data privacy, cost control | Hardware requirements, maintenance | High-security environments, specialized use cases |
| API-based LLMs | Simplicity, no maintenance | Ongoing costs, potential vendor lock-in | General applications, rapid development |
| Hybrid | Flexibility, best of both worlds | Complexity in implementation | Enterprise with mixed requirements |

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

- Environment-based configuration for sensitive values
- Docker isolation for deployment security
- Input validation to prevent prompt injection
- Basic rate limiting

### Enterprise Security Enhancements

- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Data anonymization for sensitive information
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events
- Advanced rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Secrets management with vault solutions



## Constraints

- Computational Resources: The prototype uses a pre-trained LLM (via OpenAI’s API) rather than a locally hosted model, minimizing resource demands.
- API Key Security: Personal API keys are excluded from the codebase. Users must supply their own keys for OpenWeatherMap and Alpha Vantage, as noted in the README.md.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented (e.g., for failed API requests), but it lacks advanced retry logic or fallback mechanisms.

## Scaling to Enterprise-Grade
- To evolve AskWiseAI into an enterprise-ready solution, the following enhancements address performance, security, extensibility, and observability:

### Latency & Efficiency
- Caching:
  - Purpose: Reduce latency for frequent queries (e.g., weather in popular cities).
  - Implementation: Use Redis to cache API responses with a TTL (e.g., 5 minutes for weather data).
- Asynchronous Processing:
  - Purpose: Handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
  - Implementation: Refactor main.py to use asyncio and aiohttp for non-blocking API calls.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
  - Purpose: Enhance response quality for complex queries.
  - Implementation: Integrate a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to store precomputed embeddings of common query responses, enabling fast retrieval.

### Security & Access Control
- Rate Limiting:
  - Purpose: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
  - Implementation: Use Flask-Limiter to enforce per-user or per-IP quotas (e.g., 100 requests/hour).
- API Key Management:
  - Purpose: Securely manage sensitive credentials.
  - Implementation: Store keys in a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) or .env files with python-dotenv.
- Data Redaction:
  - Purpose: Protect sensitive information in logs and responses.
  - Implementation: Filter out API keys and user data using a custom logging formatter.

### Extensibility
- Modular Tool Framework:
  - Purpose: Simplify the addition of new tools (e.g., news, currency conversion).
  - Implementation: Define tools in a JSON/YAML config file:
```json

{
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "weather",
      "function": "get_weather",
      "trigger": "[WEATHER:{location}]",
      "api_key": "WEATHER_API_KEY"
    },
    {
      "name": "stock",
      "function": "get_stock_price",
      "trigger": "[STOCK:{ticker}]",
      "api_key": "STOCK_API_KEY"
    }
  ]
}
```
Update main.py to dynamically load and invoke tools based on the config.

### Observability & Logging
- Logging:
  - Purpose: Enable debugging and performance tracking.
  - Implementation: Use Python’s logging module to log query details, response times, and errors to a file (e.g., askwise.log).
- Monitoring:
  - Purpose: Track system health and usage metrics.
  - Implementation: Integrate Prometheus for metrics (e.g., request latency, error rate) and Grafana for visualization.

### Evaluation Framework
- To ensure and improve response accuracy, an evaluation tool is proposed:

- Dataset:
  - Create a test set of 50–100 queries with expected responses (e.g., “What’s the weather in Paris?” → “The weather in Paris is 18°C with light rain”).
- Metrics:
  - Precision: Fraction of correct responses among all answers.
  - Recall: Fraction of correct responses among all relevant queries.
  - F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- Process:
Run the test set through the system, compare outputs to ground truth, and compute metrics.
Use results to refine the prompt in prompts.py (e.g., clarify tool invocation conditions).

### Bonus Features
- Conversation Memory:
  - Purpose: Maintain context across multiple queries (e.g., “What’s the weather in London?” followed by “How about Paris?”).
  - Implementation: Store query-response pairs in memory (e.g., a Python dictionary) and append recent interactions to the prompt.
  - Optimization: For enterprise use, persist context in a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) with a sliding window (e.g., last 5 turns).
